# wallpapers

This is a collection of wallpapers I've gathered over time from reddit, wallhaven, /wg/, etc. This is mainly for personal use, but someone might have similar tastes and find this useful.

Due to the fact that I've gathered these from various forums, I don't have a good way to properly attribute ownership. If you find something you own here, please let me know and I will remove if necessary or credit ownership.
